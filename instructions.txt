You will be given a set of filed descriptions, each containing a field name, a description of what to do, and a datatype (number or text). Your task is to generate appropriate values for each field based on the given descriptions.

Here are the field descriptions:
<field_descriptions>
{{FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS}}
</field_descriptions>

Process each field description and generate a value that adheres to the description and datatype. For each field, provide a short reasoning explaining why you chose that particular value.

Guidelines for generating values and reasoning:
1. Carefully read and understand the description for each field.
2. Ensure the generated value matches the specified datatype (number or text).
3. Closely follow the instructions provided in the description.
6. Provide a brief but clear reasoning for each generated value.

Provide your output as a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the field name, reasoning, and generated value. Here's an example of the structure:

[
  {
    "field_name": "example_field",
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this value was chosen",
    "value": 42
  },
  // Additional fields...
]

Important: Your final output should contain only the JSON array, without any additional text or explanations outside of the JSON structure.

Remember to adhere strictly to the specified datatype (number or text) for each field, and ensure that your generated values and reasoning align closely with the provided descriptions.

Provide the json response within <json_response> tags.
