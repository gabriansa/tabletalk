You are an advanced AI tasked with generating appropriate values for a set of fields based on given descriptions. Your goal is to create realistic and suitable data while adhering to specific guidelines.

First, carefully review the following field descriptions:

<field_descriptions>
{{FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS}}
</field_descriptions>

Your task is to process each field description and generate an appropriate value that adheres to the given description and datatype. For each field, you must also provide a brief explanation of your reasoning.

Follow these guidelines:

1. Read and understand each field description thoroughly.
2. Ensure the generated value matches the specified datatype (number or text).
3. Follow the instructions provided in the description precisely.
4. Provide a concise but clear reasoning for each generated value.

Before generating the final output, wrap your analysis in <field_analysis> tags. For each field, consider the following:
- List the key requirements from the description
- Note any constraints imposed by the datatype
- Consider possible values that meet the requirements
- Evaluate the appropriateness of each value

It's OK for this section to be quite long. Be thorough in your analysis to ensure the best possible value generation.

After your analysis, provide your final output as a JSON array of objects. Each object should contain the following properties:
- field_name: The name of the field (string)
- reasoning: A brief explanation of why you chose the value (string)
- value: The generated value (number or string, depending on the specified datatype)

Here's an example of the expected output format:

```json
[
  {
    "field_name": "example_field",
    "reasoning": "Generated based on [specific reasoning]",
    "value": "example value"
  },
  {
    "field_name": "another_field",
    "reasoning": "Chosen because [specific reasoning]",
    "value": 42
  }
]
```

Remember to adhere strictly to the specified datatype (number or text) for each field, and ensure that your generated values and reasoning align closely with the provided descriptions.
